Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant mathematician who was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Madras Presidency, British India. He was a self-taught mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite facing numerous obstacles, including poverty, illness, and lack of formal education, he went on to become one of the most renowned mathematicians of the 20th century.</p>
<p>
Ramanujan's early life was marked by poverty and illness. His father was a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop, and his mother was a housewife. From a young age, Ramanujan displayed an extraordinary aptitude for mathematics, and he spent most of his time studying on his own. By the time he was 13 years old, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of his school textbooks and started to explore more advanced mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>
Ramanujan's talent was recognized by a local teacher who helped him gain admission to the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam. However, he failed most of his other subjects, including English, and dropped out of college after two years. He then worked as a clerk in various places, all the while continuing to pursue his passion for mathematics.</p>
<p>
In 1910, Ramanujan sent a letter to the famous British mathematician G.H. Hardy, along with some of his mathematical work. Hardy was astounded by Ramanujan's talent and invited him to study in England. Ramanujan arrived in England in 1914 and worked with Hardy at the University of Cambridge.  </p>
<p>
During his time at Cambridge, Ramanujan made several significant contributions to number theory, including his famous formula for the partition function, which expresses the number of ways a given integer can be written as a sum of positive integers. He also worked on continued fractions and infinite series, and his work has had a profound influence on modern mathematics.</p>
<p>
Despite his remarkable contributions to mathematics, Ramanujan faced several challenges during his time in England. He struggled with the cold and damp climate, which worsened his already fragile health. He also faced discrimination due to his race and lack of formal education. Despite these obstacles, Ramanujan persevered and continued to make groundbreaking contributions to mathematics until his death at the young age of 32.</p>
<p>
Today, Ramanujan is celebrated as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work continues to inspire mathematicians around the world. His life story is a testament to the power of perseverance, talent, and passion, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the incredible potential of the human mind.
